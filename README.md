# Image-classification-using-Deep-Learning
Developed an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Network to classify images of different datasets such as greyscale images of different datasets given below:

1. 32x32 greyscale images of hand written digits 0-9 # MNIST dataset.
2. 28x28 greyscale images of 10 articles of clothing, fashion # MNIST dataset.
3. 8x1 vectors of spectral characteristics of astronomical images into three classes : Galaxy, Star and Quasar # SDSS17 dataset.
4. 60x60 color images (i.e., 3D tensors) of cats, dogs and wild animals # Animal Faces Color Images.
5. 60x60 color images of street signs of 43 different classes # Street Signs Color Image Dataset.
